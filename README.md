# comparison
files to get the error about the image


All files of the image, and the image itself, are here: /home/nicolas/object-detection/images/test --- this is in my computer
I couldn't make a folder in git, that is why i give you everything like this

you would have to change the paths i already put in the comparison code, or create this folders.

thanks.
